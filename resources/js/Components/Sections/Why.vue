                    <p>Technology is expensive. It's also a powerful enabler for good.</p>
                    <p>It's our goal to bridge the gap between intentions and capability. We choose clients who want to
                        improve the world and could do so better with a technical helping hand.</p>
                    <p>We work for you because we believe in what you do and want to see you achieve it.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3 class="pt-5 font-bold">We're worth it, too</h3>
                    <p>Our volunteers want to be here. We provide technical people with a platform to give back to the
                        world by applying their valuable
                        skills altruistically. </p>
                    <p>As they work with you they'll also be building experience, knowledge, and positive
                        industry relationships.</p>
